This folder is intended to store TypeScript files that are part of the project and will be compiled into JavaScript files.

The `src/ts/export` folder is specifically used for exporting TypeScript modules or classes that can be used by other parts of the project or external modules.

When you place your TypeScript files in this folder, they will be compiled into JavaScript files and can be accessed by other parts of the project.

Make sure to follow the proper file and folder structure conventions to ensure smooth compilation and usage of your TypeScript files.
