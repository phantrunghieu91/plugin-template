The `templates` folder is typically used to store template files that are used for displaying content in the admin page or front end of a website or application. These templates are pre-designed layouts or structures that can be customized with dynamic data to create consistent and visually appealing pages. By organizing templates in a separate folder, it becomes easier to manage and update them as needed.
