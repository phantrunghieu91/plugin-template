The pages folder in your project is designed to store all files related to the admin pages of your plugin. This organizational strategy helps in managing the admin section of your plugin more efficiently. Here's how the pages folder is utilized in the context of the provided PHP code from your plugin template:

Centralized Location for Admin Pages: The pages folder acts as a centralized location for all admin page files. This makes it easier to navigate, organize, and manage the admin section of your plugin. By having all admin-related files in one place, you can quickly locate and modify them as needed.

Structured Project Directory: Keeping admin page files in the pages folder contributes to a clean and structured project directory. This organization is crucial for maintaining a large codebase, making it easier for you and other developers to understand the project's structure and navigate through the files.

Ease of Navigation: The ability to create subfolders within the pages folder allows for further categorization of admin pages based on their functionality or purpose. This hierarchical organization makes it even simpler to find specific admin pages, enhancing the development workflow.

Updating Links and References: Whenever you add new files to the pages folder or reorganize existing ones, it's important to update the necessary links and references in your code. This ensures that your plugin functions correctly and can locate the admin page files when needed.

Integration with Plugin Code: In the provided PHP code, the Dashboard class within the `inc\pages` namespace demonstrates how admin pages are registered and managed within the plugin. The setPages method defines the properties of the admin pages, such as title, menu title, capability, menu slug, and callback function for rendering the page. This method directly relates to the organization and functionality provided by the pages folder, as it dictates how the admin pages are structured and accessed within the WordPress admin area.

Customization and Expansion: The flexibility of the pages folder allows for easy customization and expansion of your plugin's admin section. As your plugin grows, you can add more admin pages and organize them within the pages folder, keeping your project scalable and manageable.
