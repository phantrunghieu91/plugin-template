The `callbacks` folder is used to store callback functions in your project. Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed at a later point in time. They are commonly used in event-driven programming or asynchronous operations. By organizing your callback functions in the `callbacks` folder, you can easily locate and manage them within your project.
